# undercustoms
A very minimal and simple standalone wordpress theme. Goal is great performance providing only essential features, no shitload of crap like those million dollor themes with thousands of features and nightmare to set up.

ALPHA VERSION (use at your own risk)

CORE FEATURES (working on them):
• Bootstrap 4 Latest Framework (will be updated regularly)
• Using the Bootstrap features as much as possible (like navigation menu, carousels, cards, popups etc)
• Parallax sections using simpleParallax.js
• Scroll Animation effects using WOW Animate.css
• Lightbox for images and Videos using Fancybox 3
• New Item Slider using the Tiny Slider 
• Customization based on Customizer Wordpress API
• Woocommerce Ready and Stylized
• Multiple Layouts for Header, Footers
• Regular updates to whole codebase


Feel free to provide any suggestions or anything.
